# Free Editor - Shared IDE

[**Shared IDE**](https://shared-ide.com/) is an advanced, browser-based collaborative coding platform designed to replace traditional tech interview editors. It allows users to run code with terminal-like output and, in the full version, provides real-time collaboration and AI assistance.

## About Free Editor

This repository hosts the **open-source, free version** of the Shared IDE editor. While it offers a powerful and user-friendly code editing experience, the **free editor** is a **standalone** version that comes with limited features compared to the full platform. 

### What This Free Editor Offers:
- A fully-featured **code editor** built with modern web technologies.
- **Syntax highlighting** and basic editing functionalities.
- Built using **AnalogJS** and **Angular Material UI** for a smooth, responsive user experience.

### Whatâ€™s Not Included:
- **Collaborative coding**: The free editor does not support real-time collaboration between users.
- **AI Integration**: The option for AI assistance is not available in this version.
- **Data Storage**: The free editor currently does not offer persistent storage for projects or code.
- **Chat functionality**: This editor is for single-person use only and does not include a chat feature.

This free version provides a streamlined coding environment that is perfect for individual coding tasks and experiments.
